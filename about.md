My name is Marisa and I’m a self-taught artist and an art therapist in training from Germany. Like most of us, I started painting as a child in preschool and I continued doing so until this day. My art changed with me over time; With every new phase in my life that I entered, my art went through a new phase, too. Art is not only my passion, but it is also a way of coping with the rough patches that life naturally has. I feel more relaxed and closer to myself when I create daily. Today my art is mostly about mental health and healing from childhood trauma, which is certainly influenced by my other great passion: giving therapy.

I'm deeply touched by humans, their vulnerability and tender hearts. I love learning about how we can heal from what happened to us in the past, so we can take in our place in the now and truly connect with ourselves and others. I love being of service to other people by accompanying them while they explore and heal themselves. My career as a therapist is just starting and I couldn’t be more excited about it. Please note that I don’t offer art therapy sessions yet, but that it is one of the goals I’m currently working towards. Until then, stay tuned and please enjoy my art and the stories behind it :)
