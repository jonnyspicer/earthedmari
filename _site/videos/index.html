        <h2>Acrylic Painting Time-Lapse | Magical Landscape</h2>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTTJI0tJh5g" width="700" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        <p>Hi everyone! In this video you can see the complete process of my magical landscape painting. I often make little doodles like simple ink drawings or smaller watercolor paintings and then translate them into bigger acrylic paintings. That is also what I did here. </p>

        <h2>Painting With Hands - Intuitive Process of an Acrylic Painting</h2>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Go0cWRzudeg" width="700" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        <p>Here's the time lapse video that shows the process of my first large scale painting. As for tools, I do use normal paint brushes but I prefer painting with sponges and my own hands. Loved every second of it :) </p>

        <h2>Painting With Hands - Another Intuitive Process of an Acrylic Painting</h2>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTTJI0tJh5g" width="700" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        <p>I rarely give titles to my paintings. I do connect them with specific emotions, so I guess I could name them after these. But I often feel like there are no words that can summarize the intensity of those emotions and the symbolic meaning of the painting. And ultimately this is one of the reasons I paint in the first place; Because it allows me to show, instead of explaining with words. </p>

        <h2>Painting With Hands (No. 3)</h2>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTTJI0tJh5g" width="700" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        <p>This is one of the few pieces where I had no ideas in my head of what I wanted to make, but where I was completely lead by intuition. It's not easy to switch off your mind. There's always thoughts running through, always the nagging of expectations and how, if it's not mind-blowing, it's not "good enough". How did I manage to switch it off then? I didn't. Thoughts are always there, expectations, fears and worries come and go. I tried focusing on the colors, so I used the visual component more (and the cognitive less) and became very mindful of how I wanted to use these colors (affective component). And after hours of smearing around and trying to listen to my intuition, things took form. In the video you see the complete physical process. Observe how often I change my mind, how I modify what I already painted and how the outcome looks totally different than what I start with. The process is messy and authentic - beautiful in its own way. </p>
