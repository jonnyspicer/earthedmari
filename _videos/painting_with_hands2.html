title: Painting With Hands - Another Intuitive Process of an Acrylic Painting
description: I rarely give titles to my paintings. I do connect them with specific emotions, so I guess I could name them after these. But I often feel like there are no words that can summarize the intensity of those emotions and the symbolic meaning of the painting. And ultimately this is one of the reasons I paint in the first place; Because it allows me to show, instead of explaining with words.
