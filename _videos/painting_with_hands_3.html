title: Painting With Hands (No. 3)
description: This is one of the few pieces where I had no ideas in my head of what I wanted to make, but where I was completely lead by intuition. It's not easy to switch off your mind. There's always thoughts running through, always the nagging of expectations and how, if it's not mind-blowing, it's not "good enough". How did I manage to switch it off then? I didn't. Thoughts are always there, expectations, fears and worries come and go. I tried focusing on the colors, so I used the visual component more (and the cognitive less) and became very mindful of how I wanted to use these colors (affective component). And after hours of smearing around and trying to listen to my intuition, things took form. In the video you see the complete physical process. Observe how often I change my mind, how I modify what I already painted and how the outcome looks totally different than what I start with. The process is messy and authentic - beautiful in its own way.
